# ansible_servicebus
Azure Service Bus is an enterprise integration message broker. Service bus supports two types of communication: queues and topics.
Queues support asynchronous communications between applications. An app sends message to a queue, which stores the messages. The receiving application then connects to and reads the messages from the queue. 
Topics support the publish-subscribe pattern to enable a one-to-many relationashi between the message originator and the message receiver(s)
